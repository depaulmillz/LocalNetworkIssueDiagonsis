# LocalNetworkIssueDiagonsis
I created this project after creating a local BIND DNS server for my house. That way it is easier to diagnose issues.
It tests out a couple different potential issues to determine what is wrong. It does this by pinging servers.
All that needs to be modified for anyone to use this for themselves on their network is the gateway address.
